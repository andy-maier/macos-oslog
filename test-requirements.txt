# Pip requirements file for development.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance.
#
# Make sure that the minimum versions required in this file are consistent with
# the minimum versions specified in minimum-constraints.txt.


# Unit test direct dependencies (e.g. imports into testcases):

# pytest
# pytest 5.0.0 has removed support for Python < 3.5
# pytest 4.3.1 solves an issue on Python 3 with minimum package levels

# Install test direct dependencies:

# virtualenv
# Virtualenv 20.0.19 has an issue where it does not install pip on Python 3.4.
# Virtualenv 20.0.32 has an issue where it raises AttributeError on Python 3.4.
# tox 3.21.0 requires virtualenv!=20.0.[0-7],>=16.0.0 and requires py>=3.5
